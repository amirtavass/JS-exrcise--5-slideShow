<h1>slideShow Exercise</h1>
It's a slideShow with pictures that automatically slides the pictures but if you hover the buttons it will stop at the picture you're currently watching.
<h2>Strategy</h2>
my strategy at first was to not use JS and tried to move them with CSS and then when I wrote that I wanted pictures to slide automatically so in JS I wrote a fuction to change the photos and put the function in a setTimeOut. then another function will stop the timeOut when the mouse is over the buttons
